This package provides ggplot2 themes and colour palettes, as well as rmarkdown templates for use by [NCL ICB analytical teams](http://www.nclhealthandcare.org.uk).

## Install Instructions

This package can be installed using `devtools` or `remotes`:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ncl-icb-analytics/NCLRtemplates")

remotes::install_github("ncl-icb-analytics/NCLRtemplates")
```

All of the exported functions start with the prefix "ncl_theme_", except for the ggplot2 gradient colour scale functions,
which are of the form scale_*_ncl.

## Usage

The packages documentation can be found [here](https://ncl-icb-analytics.github.io/NCLRtemplates/).
